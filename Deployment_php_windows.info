â‡’ to open the Phpmyadmin in the browser of using link In RDp go to the xampp control Panel

) on Apache click on config = change local TO all granted. Then you can See The database In the browser

in RDP WE Have to change local to all granted in Apache(httpd Xampp.conf) after changing we have stop apache and start again then we can access it in browser

NOTE:

After Creating all the setup every thing works well, but if we take the backup of the instance and again we launch the new instance from the backup taken.

we again have to connect to RDP and again open the Xampp control panel and again we have to start Apache and SQL.

To over come this we need to follow few steps

Start menu and search for Task Scheduler

Select Task Scheduler library==> go to Action Tab above ==> select New folder and give new folder and create folder => ok

Go to the Folder created ==> In Action tab again ==> Create task

In General => Give name => Select Run whether user is logged on or not => select Run with highest priviliges

In Triggers => Select At startUP ==> make sure Enabled check box is checked

In Actions => New => Browser select Xammp folder select xampp control.exe =>

In condition ==> ok

In settions ==>ok after that enter the password of the Ec2 instance

You can find after restarting the RDP of that instance we can find the control panel automatically started

=========================================================
