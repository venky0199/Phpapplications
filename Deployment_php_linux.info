PHP deployment for linux ===================================================================== In chrome search for xampp downloan and copy link address for linux

in linux server wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/XAMPP%20Linux/8.2.12/xampp-linux-x64-8.2.12-0-installer.run

chmod +x xampp-linux-x64-8.2.12-0-installer.run (This is used to change the file to an executable file)

./xampp-linux-x64-8.2.12-0-installer.run (Execute the file) and click enter 3-4 times

There you can find the path that our xampp files installed i.e /opt/lampp

go to the path cd /opt/lampp/ here you can finf all the files

in htdocs folder you can keep all the php files

To access phpmyadmin in browser

go to the path /opt/lampp/etc/extra/

in file vi httpd-xampp.conf in line 13 remove local (Require local) to all granted(Require all granted) you can access phpmyadmin in browser restart the lampp server by

Restart : in root /opt/lampp/lampp restart

If we create image and launch and instance then again we have to start server by in root /opt/lampp/lampp start

To avoid that we have to do some set up like:

in linux crontab -e

@reboot /opt/lampp/lampp start
